Worked examples for talk: Producing and evaluating machine learning models.

Lecture slides: CV.pdf

Files:

The files below are telegraphic examples used to generate the graphs and numbers in the presentation. Once can in principle work through them using R ( https://cran.r-project.org ), RStudio ( https://www.rstudio.com ), and the referenced packages.  They are not complete tutorials, but used to generate the number for the included presentation slides.
