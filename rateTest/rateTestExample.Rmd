# R example working a rate significance test related to the problem stated in http://blog.sumall.com/journal/optimizely-got-me-fired.html
# See: http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/05/a-clear-picture-of-power-and-significance-in-ab-tests/ for more writing on this
# Note: we are using exact tail-probability from the binomial distribution exactly.   This is easy
# to do (as it is a built in function in many languages) and more faithful to the underlying
# assumed model than using a normal approximation (though a normal approximation is certainly good enough).

# For our null-hypothesis assume the two rates are identical.
# under this hypothesis we can pool the data to get an estimate of what
# common rate we are looking at.  Not we don't actually know the common
# rate, so using a single number from the data is a bit of a short-cut.
baseRate <- sum(d$conversions)/sum(d$visitors)

# Write down how far the observed counts are from the expected values.

   variable.name='assumedNullDistribution',value.name='probability')
# In this plot the two distributions are assumed to have the same
# conversion rate, so the only distributional difference is from the
# different total number of visitors.  The vertical lines are the
# observed conversion counts for each group.
ggplot(data=thinD,aes(x=conversions,y=probability,color=assumedNullDistribution)) + 
   geom_line() + geom_vline(data=d,aes(xintercept=conversions,color=name))


# The important thing to remember is your exact
# significances/probabilities are a function of the unknown true rates,
# your data, and your modeling assumptions. The usual advice is to
# control the undesirable dependence on modeling assumptions by using only "brand
# name tests." I actually prefer using ad-hoc tests, but discussion what
# is assumed in them (one-sided/two-sided, pooled data for null, and so
# on). You definitely can't assume away a thumb on the scale.

# Also this calculation is not compensating for any multiple trial or
# early stopping effect.  It (rightly or wrongly) assumes this is the only
# experiment run and it was stopped without looking at the rates.
